    "- useful to learn **non linear** hypothesis,\n",
    "- adding many features to learn non linear hypothesis can in general lead to overfitting, while **neural networks** can work with less,\n",
    "- the idea is a computational unit which takes inputs (**neurons**, including the _bias neuron_) and computes a value through its **activation function**,\n",
    "- several layers of these units can be connected forming a network,\n",
    "- a neural network is parametrized by its **weights**,\n",
    "- the output of each layer becomes the input of the following, thus the network builds several layers of activations,\n",
    "- the matrix of weights from a $n$-dimensional layer $j$ to a $m$-dimensional layer $j+1$ is $\\Theta^{(j)}_{ab}$ where $a = 1, 2, \\dots, m$ and $b = 1, 2, \\dots, n$. Therefore $\\Theta^{(j)} \\in \\mathrm{M}^{m \\times n}(\\mathbb{R})$,\n",
    "- the computation of activations layer after layer is also called **forward propagation**,\n",
    "- the neural network is basically learning successive layers of information which has been previously calculated by the network itself.\n",

    "## Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "- one way to \"negate\" one input is to use negative, larger than bisas weights (for logistic activation function),\n",
    "- we can output more than just one unit to perform one-vs-all classification."
